### Welcome to Fire.

**Fire** is a modpack for people who just want to **play** Minecraft. No need to install dozens of mods, texture packs, or tweak endless settings — just **_plug and play_**.

Thanks to [**Simple Modpack Update Checker**](https://modrinth.com/mod/smuc), you no longer need to check for updates manually — the game notifies you when a new update is available. Boom, more time to play!

## ⚡ OptiFine Parity

Some OptiFine features are supported thanks to Fabric mods. While not everything works perfectly, **Fire** supports many OptiFine-like features — including **capes** (thanks to the [**Capes**](https://modrinth.com/mod/capes) mod) and more!
