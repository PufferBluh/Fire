## Feels familiar 

Fire's UI elements aren't that much different from [**Fabulously Optimized**](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), or even [**Remarkably Optimized**](https://modrinth.com/modpack/remarkably), and the only big difference from vanilla Minecraft - Is Sodium's own GUI for Video Settings, that You can easily disable by `` Shift + P `` combination.

---

## Built on Fabric, built to last.

[**Fabric**](https://fabricmc.net/) is one of the most lightest and fast mod-loaders in Minecraft community, and also, it's the most popular mod-loader in Minecraft community.

## OptiFine Parity

**Fire** supports most of OptiFine features, like Entity Model Features, OptiFine capes, an many others.
